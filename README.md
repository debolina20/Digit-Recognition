The Digit Recognition is a Image Classification project using Deep Learning Models. The idea is to enable a machine to take an input of a handwritten digit image and determine the digit. The GUI to display the digits is developed using a Python interface.

Since different people have different handwriting, the MNIST dataset that contains 60,000 samples of handwritten digits, is used to train the model. The MNIST dataset is available in Kaggle.
