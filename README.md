The Digit Recognition is a Image Classification project using Deep Learning Models. The idea is to enable a machine to take an input of a handwritten digit and determine the digit. The GUI is developed using a Python interface.

Since different people have different handwriting, the MNIST dataset that contains 60,000 samples of handwritten digits, is used to train the model.
