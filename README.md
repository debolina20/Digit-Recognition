**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Accurate digit recognition is a critical challenge in various applications, from optical character recognition to automation and artificial intelligence. Handwritten or printed digits, often distorted by varying styles and diverse backgrounds, pose difficulties for conventional algorithms. Existing models may struggle with robustness, making it challenging to precisely identify digits in real-world scenarios. Inaccuracies in recognition impact automation processes, data entry, and authentication systems. Addressing this problem requires the development of advanced digit recognition systems that can adapt to diverse writing styles and ensure high accuracy across a range of applications, contributing to the seamless integration of digit recognition technology into various domains.

**OBJECTIVE**

- Develop a machine learning-based digit recognition system with accuracy and adaptability.
- Employ algorithms to enable precise identification of handwritten digits, since different people have different handwriting. 

**DATASET USED**

The dataset of MNIST have been taken to train the model from Kaggle.

**PYTHON LIBRARIES USED**

1. Numpy
2. Keras
3. Tkinter module
